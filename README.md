# Pharmacy_ML_Process

The project aims to predict the potential profit of each medicine sold in Indonesia by analyzing the sales data and identifying the key factors that influence the profit potential using machine learning techniques, specifically decision tree and random forest algorithms. This is important because the pharmaceutical industry in Indonesia is rapidly growing, and predicting the profit potential of each medicine sold can be challenging due to the diverse geography and regional differences.

The proposed approach to solve this problem is to collect and clean the sales data, preprocess it, and analyze it using decision tree and random forest algorithms. The models will be trained, validated, and optimized to evaluate their performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the metric. The lower the MAE, the better the model's accuracy, and a successful model should have a low MAE value, indicating accurate predictions.

The dataset used in this project is a sample internal company dataset with masking data that consists of various features such as the medicine name, distribution channels, and regional information. The target variable is the profit potential of each medicine sold in Indonesia. The two machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree and Random Forest, will be used to predict the profit potential of each medicine sold in Indonesia. Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that builds a tree-like model of decisions, and Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust model.
